A. what is machine learning?
for task, has a performance plan. 
then computer can use auto learn the experience of the task.
1. part 1
for more comfortable, good， amount exprience to enhance the performance of the task.

ML is one sub branch of AI.

base on know data, 
(x1,1)  (x2, 0)  (x3, 0) (x4, 1) (x5, 1)

unbalance data
click per day
ill

business, to check the data. 

accurate to check the model is good or bad.

2. part 2

3. part 3
what can be resolved by ML?
a. data clean / 
b.  model / enhance parameter


4. part 4
classifier

5. part 5 
based on training data (include x, y), create a model
feature vectors, algorithm

expected label

    5.1 get data
    5.2 clean data
    5.3 get feature ***
    5.4 create model

get more feature from business experts

6. algorithm, 
different assumption on data
基于数据做不同的假设
different scalability profiles at training time
训练时间不同的规模
different latencies at prediction time

different mode size (embedability in mobile devices)
模型大小

7. DL is on branch of ML. 1959
